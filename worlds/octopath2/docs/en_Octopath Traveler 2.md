# Octopath Traveler 2

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Changes from the vanilla game</h2>

Octopath Traveler 2 is a game that is pretty open from the start-up, and while each character has their story-line, inside of these stories it ends up kind of linear. This randomizer aims of course at randomizing items at various locations, but also locking various things in ways they aren't in a vanilla playthrough.

More formally, these changes are in effect :
- Characters access must be unlocked;
- Regions access must be unlocked;
- Towns access must be unlocked;
- Items and locations are randomized (with many options on what to randomize), from chests to main quest rewards, side-quests and NPC items;
- Multiple goals are available with varying expected playtime.

- Only one character is available from the start;
- Only one region (out of Wildlands, Leaflands, etc.) is available at the start. As an example, if you start with Agnea, you have the entire non-town Leaflands available, from Cropdale to Timberain. Towns aren't available by default.
- Each region has an unlock item. In order to access those regions, you need both the unlock item and a way to reach it.
- Every town is locked by default. In order to unlock a town, you need any "chapter unlock" item tied to a chapter that happens in that town (as an example, you can unlock)

#This randomizer creates a more dynamic play experience by randomizing the locations of most items in Kingdom Hearts 2. Currently all items within Chests, Popups, Get Bonuses, Form Levels, and Sora's Levels are randomized. This allows abilities that Sora would normally have to be placed on Keyblades with random stats. Additionally, there are several options for ways to finish the game, allowing for different goals beyond beating the final boss.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>Where is the settings page</h2>

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.


<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What is randomized in this game?</h2>

As of now, only chests are randomized into the item pool. It is planned to add main quest rewards, side-quest rewards and NPC steal/purchase into the item pool.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What Octopath Traveler 2 items can appear in other players' worlds?</h2>


Most progression items are characters unlock, regions unlock and chapters unlock. Additionnally, a bunch of strong pieces of gear are added to the pool. The remaining locations are filled with consumables.


<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What does another world's item look like in Octopath Traveler 2?</h2>


In Octopath Traveler 2, as of now items which need to be sent to other worlds appear in any chest in the vanilla game. Upon obtaining the item, it will be sent to its home world.

<h2 style="text-transform:none";>When the player receives an item, what happens?</h2>

It is added to your inventory.

#<h2 style="text-transform:none";>What Happens if I die before Room Saving?</h2>


#When you die in vanilla Kingdom Hearts 2, you are reverted to the last non-boss room you entered and your status is reverted to what it was at that time. However, in archipelago, any item that you have sent/received will not be taken away from the player, any chest you have opened will remain open, and you will keep your level, but lose the experience.


#For example, if you are fighting Roxas, receive Reflect Element, then die mid-fight, you will keep that Reflect Element. You will still need to pause your game to have it show up in your inventory, then enter a new room for it to become properly usable.
